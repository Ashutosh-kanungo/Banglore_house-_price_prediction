# BANGLORE_HOUSE_PRICE_PREDICTION
Bangalore, also known as the Silicon Valley of India, is a thriving metropolitan city with a booming real estate industry. With a constantly growing population and an increasing demand for housing, predicting house prices accurately has become an essential task for buyers, sellers, and investors alike. Machine Learning algorithms can help predict the price of a house based on several factors such as location, area, number of bedrooms, and many more. In this project, we aim to develop a model that can predict the price of houses in Bangalore using various features of the properties. Our goal is to build an accurate and robust model that can assist buyers, sellers, and real estate agents in making informed decisions based on the predicted house prices.
